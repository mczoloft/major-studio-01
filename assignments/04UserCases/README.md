# GDP per capita vs. ECI vs GINI in SubSaharan Africa 

## Intro

This is a project where we pick up Chapter 5 from the *Income Inequality Trends in sub-Saharan Africa* and its focus on how to develop African economies (with all its weakness and strenghs). The author chooses the Economic Complexity Index as a tool to understand sub-Saharan countries. The ECI, though, is a black box; even with a whole section trying to unpack its logic, it's a pretty difficult concept. The authors try to use it with other indexes such as the log of GDP as a way to see correlations and understand its behavior, but maybe there's a chance to translate its effects in real world with variables that are closer to real-life experiences. Hence, we intersect the ECI with not only its log of GDP per capita, but also the GINI. Here we have a 3-pointed index, pointing out different traits for each Country: their techincal abilities, their abundance and its effect on society.
