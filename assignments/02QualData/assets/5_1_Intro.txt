Since 2000, Africa has experienced high levels of economic growth. Between 2000 and 2015, sub-Saharan Africa grew at a rate of 5.04 per cent per annum (World Bank, 2016). However, a large portion of the population has not benefitted from this growth. In 2012, 42.7 per cent of SSA lived on less than US$1.90 a day (Beegle et al., 2016). Africa’s Gini coefficient in 2010 was 0.435 (Cornia, 2016).2 The number of poor people increased from 280 million to 330 million in 2012 (World Bank, 2016). A survey of 35 African countries showed that there was ”little evidence for systemic reduction of lived poverty” (Dulani, Mattes and Logan, 2013:1).
The persistence of poverty and inequality is primarily because of slow job growth, especially for youth (15–24 years). Between 2000 and 2008, the African working-age population (15– 64 years) increased from 443 to 550 million, but only 73 million jobs were created over the same period (AfDB et al., 2012; ILO, 2011). Youth only obtained 16 million, or 22.0 per cent, of those jobs (ILO, 2011). The lack of jobs for this population has resulted in youth unemployment accounting for rate of 60.0 per cent of the total unemployed (AfDB et al., 2012). In a continent in which half the population is under 25 years of age (Brooks et al., 2014), economic transformation is required to take advantage of the youthful population.
To reduce poverty and inequality, the only option available to policymakers – at least in terms of industrial policy – is to create more jobs that are characterised by higher levels of productivity and remuneration (Söderbom and Teal, 2003). To increase aggregate productivity and income, a country must undergo structural transformation, that is, shift away from the low productivity agriculture sector toward higher productivity sectors (McMillan, Rodrik and Verduzco-Gallo, 2014). Economic growth is a prerequisite for creating better paying jobs, but without access to these jobs, poverty alleviation will be modest (Söderbom and Teal, 2003).
In the African context, most new, high-productivity jobs should ideally be in the manufacturing sector. It has two distinct advantages over other high-productivity sectors, such as mining or services. Manufacturing is one of the sectors that is both labour-intensive and export-oriented (ibid.). The latter advantage is particularly relevant to Africa, as the continent’s domestic markets are small and cannot sustain the high levels of growth required to reduce poverty and inequality.
However, recent experience in Africa suggests that despite strong economic growth over the past decade, the manufacturing sector has declined. Between 1981 and 1985, the average share of the manufacturing sector in Africa (excluding South Africa) was 14.7 per cent of GDP (World Bank, 2016). This declined to an average of 10.4 per cent of GDP between 2010 and 2014 (World Bank, 2016). Similarly, there was little change in manufacturing employment (World Bank, 2013). Rodrik (2014) and McMillan and Harttgen (2014) find that the main driver behind the ‘African growth miracle’ is the sizable expansion of the services sector. Essentially, the post-2000 period of growth in Africa witnessed the declining importance of agriculture and manufacturing and a significant increase in the importance of services.
Given that structural transformation is vital to sustained long-run economic growth and development, the evidence suggesting limited structural transformation remains a key cause for concern for Africa’s development trajectory. The sustainability of Africa’s long-run economic performance is important because it has an impact on the continent’s ability to achieve key developmental objectives, such as poverty reduction, a more equitable distribution of income, enhanced human capital accumulation and improved infrastructure.
With the marginal performance of manufacturing in Africa in mind, this chapter explores which factors may be constraining the growth of manufacturing. If such growth is key to economic growth- enhancing structural transformation, then understanding the factors that are constraining this type of growth is of prime importance. The question regarding the constraints on manufacturing in Africa is approached by employing the Atlas of Economic Complexity analytical framework developed by Hausmann et al. (2011). First, we use this framework to examine evidence of structural transformation in Africa and then tailor it to provide insight into manufacturing performance across African countries. Second, we incorporate the 'economic complexity' and 'opportunity value' indices derived from the Atlas of Economic Complexity analytical framework into regression estimates that examine the factors constraining manufacturing performance.
This chapter is structured as follows: first, using the Atlas of Economic Complexity analytical framework, the extent of manufacturing-led structural transformation in Africa is examined; second, the methodology and data employed in the econometric analysis are outlined, followed by a discussion on the regression results; and finally, the chapter provides some policy implications resulting from the analysis.
