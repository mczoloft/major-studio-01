# Assignment 03
*Dynamic and Interactivity for Major Studio 01 – Fall 2017 – MSc Data Visualization*

Here are the ideas for this assignment.

### Intro

This is a project where we come up with a research question that binds together the 2 previous assignments. We use the **quantitative** approach from Exercise #1 and try to apply it to the Exercise #2 problems and issues.

But what are these issues? By picking Chapter 5 from the *Income Inequality Trends in sub-Saharan Africa*, the focus is on how to develop African economies (with all its weakness and strenghs). The author chooses the Economic Complexity Index as a tool to understand sub-Saharan countries. (Needs more clarity)

The ECI, though, is a black box; even with a whole box trying to unpack its logic, it's a pretty difficult concept. The authors try to use it with other indexes such as the log of GDP as a way to see correlations and understand its behavior, but maybe there's a chance to translate its effects in real world with variables that are closer to real-life experiences.

Hence, we intersect the ECI with not only its GDP per capita, but also the GINI. Here we have a 3-pointed index, pointing out different traits for each Country: their techincal abilities, their abundance and its effect on society.

### Getting to see all of this (sketches and iterations)

To visualize these indexes and get some sort of understanding from them, I've then sketched out some ideas where I could translate 3 simple numeric values into graphical indexes.

### Data specifications and practices

Here is what I did with the data (modelling and database); what are the sources and how to get from there to the question.
